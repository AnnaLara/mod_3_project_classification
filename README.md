### Context
A person makes a doctor appointment, receives all the instructions and no-show. Who to blame? 

### Content
300k medical appointments and its 15 variables (characteristics) of each. The most important one if the patient show-up or no-show the appointment.

## Introduction

In this lesson, we'll review all the guidelines and specifications for the final project for Module 3.


## Objectives

* Understand all required aspects of the Final Project for Module 3
* Understand all required deliverables
* Understand what constitutes a successful project

## Final Project Summary

Congratulations! You've made it through another _intense_ module, and now you're ready to show off your newfound Machine Learning skills!

All that remains for Module 3 is to complete the final project!

## The Project

For this project, you're going to select a dataset of your choosing and create a classification model. You'll start by identifying a problem you can solve with classification, and then identify a dataset. You'll then use everything you've learned about Data Science and Machine Learning thus far to source a dataset, preprocess and explore it, and then build and interpret a classification model that answers your chosen question.


### Selecting a Data Set

We encourage you to be very thoughtful when identifying your problem and selecting your data set--an overscoped project goal or a poor data set can quickly bring an otherwise promising project to a grinding halt.

To help you select an appropriate data set for this project, we've set some guidelines:


1. Your dataset should work for classification. The classification task can be either binary or multi-categorical, as long as it's a classification model.   

2. Your dataset needs to be of sufficient complexity. Try to avoid picking an overly simple dataset. We want to see all the steps of the Data Science Process in this project--it's okay if the dataset is mostly clean, but we expect to see some preprocessing and exploration. See the following section, **_Data Set Constraints_**, for more information on this.   

3. On the other end of the spectrum, don't pick a problem that's too complex, either. Stick to problems that you have a clear idea of how you can use machine learning to solve it. For now, we recommend you stay away from overly complex problems in the domains of Natural Language Processing or Computer Vision--although those domains make use of Supervised Learning, they come with a lot of other special requirements and techniques that you don't know yet (but you'll learn soon!). If you're chosen problem feels like you've overscoped, then it probably is. If you aren't sure if your problem scope is appropriate, double check with your instructor!

4. **_Serious Bonus Points_** if some or all of the data is data you have to source yourself through web scraping or interacting with a 3rd party API! Having projects that show off your ability to source data effectively make you look that much more impressive when showing your work off to potential employers!

### Data Set Constraints

When selecting a data set, be sure to take into consideration the following constraints:

1. Your data set can't be one we've already worked with in the previous two projects. 
2. Your data set should contain a minimum of 1000 rows.    
3. Your data set should contain a minimum of 10 predictor columns, before any one-hot encoding is performed.   
4. Your instructor must provide final approval on your data set.

### Problem First, or Data First?

There are two ways that you can about getting started: **_Problem-First_** or **_Data-First_**. 

**_Problem-First_**: Start with a problem that you want to solve with classification, and then try to find the data you need to solve it. If you can't find any data to solve your problem, then you should pick another problem. 

**_Data-First_**: Take a look at some of the most popular internet repositories of cool data sets we've listed below. If you find a data set that's particularly interesting for you, then it's totally okay to build your problem around that data set. 

There are plenty of amazing places that you can get your data from. We recommend you start looking at data sets in some of these resources first:

* [UCI Machine Learning Datasets Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets.php)
* [Kaggle Datasets](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets)
* [Awesome Datasets Repo on Github](https://github.com/awesomedata/awesome-public-datasets)
* [New York City Open Data Portal](https://opendata.cityofnewyork.us/)
* [Seattle Open Data Portal](https://data.seattle.gov/)
* [Chicago Open Data Portal](https://data.cityofchicago.org/)
* [Inside AirBNB ](http://insideairbnb.com/)


## The Deliverables

There will be 2 deliverables for this project:

1. A well documented **Jupyter Notebook** containing any code you've written for this project and comments explaining it. This work will need to be pushed to your GitHub repository in order to submit your project.   

2. An executive **Keynote/PowerPoint/Google Slides presentation** (delivered as a PDF export) that explains the business problem you are solving, your findings, and their relevance to the company/stakeholders.
    + Contain between 5-10 professional quality slides detailing:
        + A high-level overview of your business problem, methodology and data source;
        + Any real-world recommendations you would like to make based on your findings (ask yourself--why should the executive team care about what you found? How can your findings help the company/stakeholder?);
        + Take no more than 10 minutes to present; and
        + Avoid technical jargon and explain results in a clear, actionable way for non-technical audiences.
    + Make sure to also add and commit this pdf of your non-technical presentation to your repository with a file name of `presentation.pdf`.


### Jupyter Notebook Must-Haves

For this project, your jupyter notebook should meet the following specifications:

**_Organization/Code Cleanliness_**

* The notebook should be well organized, easy to follow, and code is commented where appropriate.  
    * Level Up: The notebook contains well-formatted, professional looking markdown cells explaining any substantial code. All functions have docstrings that act as professional-quality documentation.  
* The notebook is written to technical audiences with a way to both understand your approach and reproduce your results. The target audience for this deliverable is other data scientists looking to validate your findings.

**_Process, Methodology, and Findings_**

* Your notebook should contain a clear record of your process and methodology for exploring and preprocessing your data, building and tuning a model, and interpreting your results.
* We recommend you use the [CRISP-DM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-industry_standard_process_for_data_mining) process to help organize your thoughts and stay on track.


## Submitting your Project

You’re almost done! In order to submit your project for review, include the following links to your work in the corresponding fields on the right-hand side of Learn.

1. **GitHub Repo:** Now that you’ve completed your project in Jupyter Notebooks, push your work to GitHub and paste that link to the right. (If you need help doing so, review the resources [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1CNGDhjcQZDRx2sWByd2v-mgUOjy13Cd_hQYVXPuzEDE/edit#gid=0).)
2. **Keynote/PowerPoint/Google Slides presentation:** be sure to commit a pdf of your non-technical presentation to the repository with a file name of `presentation.pdf`.
